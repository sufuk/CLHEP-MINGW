# CLHEP-MINGW

This repository is only for making a patch for CLHEP.
The current version of CLHEP (2.4.4.1) is not supports Mingw-w64
So I decided to make a patched version.
I barely changed anything.
You can build it easily look at my post https://sufuk.net/building-clhep-in-windows-with-mingw-w64/

I dont know if it works perfect because I am not a physicist I mam just a Software Developer.

I am not working in CERN or not in any relation with official project.
You can find every information about Official CLHEP project it in ReadmeCLHEP.md
